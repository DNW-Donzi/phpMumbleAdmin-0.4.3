/**
* If you have an "Invalid slice definition file" error with PhpMumbleAdmin:

*/

   * with php-ICE 3.2
   ******************

If you are using phpICE 3.2 with murmur 1.2.x, you need to follow theses instructions:

Open the Murmur.ice file binding with murmurd

Search for :
	dictionary<UserInfo, string> UserInfoMap;

replace with :
	dictionary<byte, string> UserInfoMap;

Restart your http daemon.


   * All others reasons:
   **********************

As an "invalid slice definitions file" is a pretty serious problem
( possibility to break the murmur configuration, PHP fatal error, and more... ),
PMA disable the ICE profile when it find this error.
The SuperAdmins have to fix the problem and re-enable the profile,
by clicking the red button on configuration->ICE.

php-ICE 3.2 / 3.3
Verify that the Murmur.ice you have loaded ( check PHP options "ice.slice", and "ice.profiles" )
is really the one you downoaded with the murmur daemon.
Don't forget to reload your http server after that.

php-ICE 3.4
Load the php-slice file of your murmur daemon. If you are not using an official major stable version of murmur,
you will have to create your own php-slice file.
See the readme.txt for more information about that.
